# Introduction

- In this document we will learn about application repository, the basic definition of a repository is that it is a management directory for stroing, structuring, and describing different versions of digital objects. and here application repositories are a type of repository used for storing all the files and resources related to a application, including its source code, configuration files, documentation, and other assets.

- These reositories play a crucial role in software development, providing a structured and version-controlled environment for developers to collaborate, track chenges, and manage the application's codebase. **Application repositories allow you to bring more powerful applications to market with less effort.**

# Purpose
### Why we need Application Repositories ?
| Why	| Description |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| Version Control |	It provides version control to tracks changes to code over time. |
| Sharing is caring | You can Share knowledge or code with others and among team members for feedback and even contribute to open-source projects. |
| Consistency | Ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments. | 
| Collaboration | Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously. |
| Traceability | It provide a history of all changes made to the application code. |



# Advantages
| No.                   | Advantages                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Version Control** | It helps to track changes and revert to previous versions if needed. |
| **Easy Collaboration** | It enables team members to work together on the same codebase. |
| **Enhanced Productivity** | Developers can trace every small change made to the code, making it easier to identify and resolve issues. This level of traceability saves time and effort. |

# Disadvantages
| No.                   | Disadvantages                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Maintenance** | Needs regulat maintenance to ensure repositories are up-to-date. |
| **Complexity** | Application repositories are large enough so with many contributors can be complex. |
| **Single repositories** | If you have one single application repository then one drawback of a single repository is that any change in one application changes the status of the whole repository. |
