# Intoduction

- Gitflow is a popular Git branching strategy aimed at simplifying release management. And Gitflow is an alternative Git branching model that involves the use of supporting branches and multiple primary branches. It was first published and made popular by **Vincent Driessen**.

# Purpose

- Fundamentally, Git flow involves isolating your work into different types of Git branches. In this article, weâ€™ll cover the different branches in the Git flow workflow. 

GitFlow is a branching model and workflow for Git that helps teams manage their codebase more effectively.

# Advantages
| No.                   | Advantages                                                                                                     |

| **1** | Using multiple separate branches in Git will provide flexibility. |
| **2** | Gitflow makes developer speed up the process with familiar branch structure. |
| **3** | It keep repository & process clean and tidy. |
| **4** | Easy bug tracking because each feature or bugfix is developed in its own branch, it's easier to track changes and identify the source of bugs. |

# Disadvantages
| No.                   | Disadvantages                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1** | Using multiple separate branches in Git will gets complex at sometimes. |
| **2** | With multiple branches being worked on simulraneously, there is a higher risk of merge conflivts, which can slow down development. |
